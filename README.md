Report on “CitySchools” Performance Analysis
The analysis focused on evaluating school performance based on several metrics, including average math and reading scores, percentage of students passing math and reading, and overall passing percentages. The data was categorized by spending per student, school size, and school type to identify trends and draw meaningful insights.
Spending Budget Impact on Performance:
Schools with higher spending per student, tend to have slightly better average math and reading scores compared to schools with lower spending. However, the increase in spending does not lead to significantly higher passing percentages, suggesting diminishing returns for higher expenditures.
Performance Based on School Size:
Smaller schools (fewer than 1,000 students) show higher overall passing percentages compared to larger schools (over 2,000 students). This suggests that smaller school environments might provide better support and attention to individual students, contributing to improved academic outcomes.
Comparison of School Types:
Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in all metrics, including average math and reading scores and passing percentages. Charter schools have higher overall passing rates, indicating their effectiveness in fostering academic success compared to district schools.
These insights provide valuable guidance for stakeholders aiming to improve student performance by optimizing resource allocation and exploring effective school management strategies.
